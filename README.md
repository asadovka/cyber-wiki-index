## Installation

## Usage

### Submit links
Basically, there are two main functions provided by `cyber-wiki` tool. 
The first one is to parse wiki titles and submit links between keywords and wiki pages. 
```
submit-links-to-cyber /home/user/enwiki-latest-all-titles --address=cli_acc_y0y
```

Here, **enwiki-latest-all-titles** is titles file obtained from 
 [official Wiki dumps](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-all-titles-in-ns0.gz).  

> Note: Uses only local cyber node.

> Note: Submit links do not add duras to ipfs.

### Uploading duras to IPFS 
Also, `cyber-wiki` has separate command `upload-duras-to-ipfs` to upload files to local IPFS. 
All duras are collected under single root unixfs directory.
```
upload-duras-to-ipfs /home/user/enwiki-latest-all-titles
```
> Note: We already upload duras. 
They can be downloaded and pined on yor local node by **Qmdwsryu8HskLzBspzPwJbL8UZ1ZPZF8VemtW1ja1GMXGp** hash.
